# Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and
# HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
# If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d <= 8 in ascending order
# of size, we get:
# 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3,
# 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
# It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.
# How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions
# for d <= 1,000,000?
