# Maximum path sum II
# Problem 67
# By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below,
# the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

# 3
# 7 4
# 2 4 6
# 8 5 9 3

# That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

# Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
# a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

# NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18.
# It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 299 altogether!
# If you could check one trillion (1012) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all.
# There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
